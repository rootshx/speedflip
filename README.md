# Speedflip
It is a revised script and comes from someone who programmed a speedflip macro in Python and posted it in the unknowncheats forum


"This is a python script to perform a speed flip in either direction (it will detect if ur clicking 'd' or 'a'). I am not sure if there is any anti-cheat system in rocket league but I am using it for now.
keep holding 'w' while the speed flip is being performed to use it the best way (not doing that will cause the car to stop/continue moving forward until you re-press the 'w' key"

I changed the hotkey from g to TMB2. So it is easier for keyboard players. The guy also has a script for the controller. You will find it by scrolling down at the UnknownCheats link

## Version 2.0
Removed all randomizers and significantly improved speedflip consistency by reducing failed attempts.

## Installation

```bash
  C:\Users\rshx\Documents> pip install keyboard mouse
  C:\Users\rshx\Documents> python speedflip.py
```
